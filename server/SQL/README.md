# About me

### A script made so we can add N amount of random users to the database

# How to use 

### In the ``/data/`` folder you'll find two SQL files. Run these files in the psql terminal using the ``\i [file-path]`` command to populate the database. The name of the file is the table it'll change.

### If you want to regenerate the data then look in the ``randomDataGeneration.py`` Python file. Run that script and it'll completely remake both files depending on the variables at the top of the script.
